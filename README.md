# **Early Prediction of Sepsis**

## **Impact and Proposed Solution**
Our solution proactively identifies individuals at risk of sepsis by analyzing key health indicators and risk factors using advanced machine learning models. By offering early prediction capabilities, this system empowers patients to seek timely medical advice and make informed decisions, potentially averting critical complications.

The societal impact of this solution is profound, with the potential to:
- Save lives by preventing severe complications and mortality.
- Reduce treatment costs through early intervention and decreased ICU admissions.
- Enable efficient resource utilization in healthcare facilities.
- Foster a culture of proactive health management and awareness.
